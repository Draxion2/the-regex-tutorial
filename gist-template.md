# Email Validation Regex Tutorial

Greetings and welcome to my regex (regular expressions) tutorial. Regex is very useful in many coding languages by extracting information from any text or strings. It searches specifically through the string for one or more matches of search patterns.

## Summary

Today I will be instructing how to break down a regular expression and that one will be a method for code to validate if user input has a valid email address when submitting data via a server (i.e signing up for an application that needs an email).

Matching an Email: 
```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/```
